# 📗 Introduction to C Programming

Welcome to the **Introduction to C Programming** repository 🚀

This repository is a beginner‑focused collection of **C programming examples, practice codes, and exercises**. It is made to help learners understand the **core fundamentals of C**, the language that sits at the root of modern programming.

C is not flashy. It’s strict, old‑school, and honest — and that’s exactly why it builds strong programmers.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Learn **C programming from scratch**
* Build strong **logic and problem‑solving skills**
* Understand how programs work **close to memory and hardware**
* Prepare a solid base for **C++, DSA, and system‑level programming**
* Keep all beginner C codes **organized in one place**

This repository is meant for learning, experimenting, breaking code, and fixing it again.

## 📚 Topics Covered

This repository includes practice and examples on:

* Basic C syntax and program structure
* Variables and data types
* Input and output
* Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
* Loops (for, while, do‑while)
* Functions
* Arrays
* Strings
* Pointers (basic level)
* Simple problem‑solving programs

The focus is on **clarity over complexity**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tauhidrana/Intorduction-to-C-programming.git
```

2. Go to any folder:

```bash
cd Intorduction-to-C-programming/Basics
```

3. Compile the C file:

```bash
gcc file.c -o file
```

4. Run the program:

```bash
./file
```

Change the code, test different inputs, and observe the output — that’s how C teaches discipline.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a **fundamentals‑first mindset**:

* Write simple code before smart code
* Understand memory, not just syntax
* Learn from mistakes
* Avoid shortcuts in the early stage

C doesn’t forgive carelessness — and that’s why it makes you better.

## 📌 Notes

* Code may look simple — that’s intentional
* Optimization is not the priority at this stage
* This is a **learning repository**, not a production project

## 🤝 Contribution

This is mainly a personal learning repository, but:

* Suggestions are welcome
* Cleaner logic is appreciated
* Better explanations help everyone
